## Strait

A strait is natural narrow water way that connects two large water bodies. In other words it can be also be defined as a thin channel of water way which separates comparatively two enormous water bodies.

Difference between strait and isthmus

Isthmus is just opposite to a Strait. A thin piece of land which connects two bigger lands is called Isthmus. For example Isthmus of Panama connects North America and South America. A canal is generally built across an isthmus artificially to promote navigation from one part to other part by water. Panama canal is such an example which connects Atlantic ocean to Pacific ocean.
